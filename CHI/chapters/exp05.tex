\section*{AIM:}
To light up LEDs in a ring counter pattern using the parallel port
\section*{THEORY:}
A parallel port is a type of interface found on computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. In computing, a parallel port is a parallel communication physical interface. It is also known as a printer port or Centronics port. The port is composed of 4 control lines, 5 status lines and 8 data lines. The connector for the parallel port is a 25 pin D-Type female connector. The parallel port pinout is as shown below:

The parallel port has three commonly used port addresses as shown below:

The parallel port is associated with three software registers namely- the data port, the status port, and the control port.
These ports can be used to read/write data and control the operation of the parallel port. A detailed description of the individual bits in these registers is given below:

The data port is simply used for outputting data on the Parallel Port's data lines (Pins 2-9). This register is normally a write only port. However, modern parallel ports are often bi-directional, and data can be read from the data port address.

The Status Port is a read only port. Any data written to this port will be ignored. The Status Port is made up of 5 input lines (Pins 10,11,12,13 \& 15), an IRQ status register and two reserved bits.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Control Port register bits}
\egroup
\end{table}

The Control Port (base address + 2) was intended as a write only port. When a printer is attached to the Parallel Port, four "controls" are used. These are Strobe, Auto Linefeed, Initialize and Select Printer, all of which are inverted
except Initialize.

The printer would not send a signal to initialize the computer, nor would it tell the computer to use auto linefeed. However these four outputs can also be used for inputs. If the computer has placed a pin high (e.g. +5v) and your device wanted to take it low, you would effectively short out the port, causing a conflict on that pin. Therefore these lines are "open collector" outputs (or open drain for CMOS devices). This means that it has two states. A low state (0v) and a high impedance state (open circuit).

Bits 4 \& 5 are internal controls. Bit four will enable the IRQ (See Using the Parallel Ports IRQ) and Bit 5 will enable the bi-directional port meaning so as to enable input of 8 bits using (DATA0-7). This mode is only possible if the card supports it. Bits 6 \& 7 are reserved. Any writes to these two bits will be ignored. 

\section*{PROCEDURE:}
\textbf{\underline{STEP 1}:}
